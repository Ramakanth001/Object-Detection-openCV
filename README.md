# Object-Detection-openCV
OpenCV (Open Source Computer Vision Library) is an open source computer vision and machine learning software library. OpenCV was built to provide a common infrastructure for computer vision applications and to accelerate the use of machine perception in the commercial products.

# **Media Procesing**
This section consists of basic image and video processing using openCV. 
typically RGB -> BGR, BGR -> Grayscale and BGR -> RGB 

# **Object Detection**
 This section conists of identification of objects that are sensed by the camera. 
 This is a machine learning algorithm and uses deep neural networks
 
 # **Dependencies**
 Install
 >opencv-python

 # **Components**
 >**Dataset** : coco.names - for labeling and segmentation
 
 >**SSD (Single-Shot multibox Detection)**: ssd_mobilenet_v3_large_coco_2020_01_14.pbtxt -  for object detection
